# Rectangle Area Calculator 🟦

This repository contains a simple Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle based on user input. It was created as part of ATMS 523 Assignment 1 to demonstrate basic Python functionality and GitHub workflows.

## 🚀 How to Run

You do **not** need Visual Studio Code to run this script. Here's how to do it using just Python and a terminal:

### 🧰 Step 1: Install Python
- Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python 3.x for your operating system.
- During installation, make sure to check the box that says **“Add Python to PATH”** (Windows only).

### 📁 Step 2: Download the Script
- Go to this GitHub repository.

### 📍 Step 4: Navigate to the Folder
Use the `cd` command to move into the folder where the script is saved. For example:
``bash
cd Downloads/module-1-part-2-using-github-workflows-Key-Roberson-main

### ▶️ Step 5: Run the Script
Type the following command:
python Simple_code.py

### ✍️ Step 6: Follow the Prompts
Enter the length and width when asked.
